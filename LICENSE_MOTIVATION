For this project we chose to use the MIT license.

We choose this license because it is permissive and rather simple
This license allows others to:
Use our code in commercial products
Modify the code freely
Keep their modificiations private
Must credit the Authors.
Do not have to open-source their code.

This makes it easy for others like researchers, developers and companies
to build on the work without legal issues. 

Q: If someone wants to use my code in a commercial product, can they?

A: Yes, they can. All they need to do is include a copy of the license and credit 
us as the original author. They do not have to open-source their own code.
